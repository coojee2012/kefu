# 使用Phantomjs进行单元测试
## Someone suggested that I should use Phantomjs instead! So I did it and below is what I did exactly and made the test pass:

> Install PhantomJS:
 ``` 
  udo npm install -g phantomjs-prebuilt
 ``` 
> Update the env variable by adding the following line to ~/.bashrc:

> export PHANTOMJS_BIN=/usr/bin/phantomjs
> Add the following line to devdependencies in package.json file within the project:

> "karma-phantomjs-launcher": "^0.2.0",
> Add the following line to karma.config.js file:
 
 ```
 plugins: [
  ...
      'karma-phantomjs-launcher',
  ...
    ]
    ```
> And finally change the browsers in karma.config.js to be:

```
browsers: ['PhantomJS'],

```
> However, I still do not know why Chrome and Firefox did not work, and Phantomjs did the job. The way I view it is my vagrant box is just an Ubuntu machine, and should not be different than any other machines! It would be great if someone explains to me the reasons. And please consider that I am a newbie.
