# Dialplan

## About

The FreeSWITCH™ dialplan is a decision tree that provides routing services to bridge call legs together, execute dialplan applications, and invoke custom scripts that you write, among other things. Much of your effort will be focused on configuring a dialplan to suit your application, whether it is the built–in XML dialplan or a database lookup query sent to a web server via xmlcurl or via PostgreSQL using freeswitch.dbh connection pooling.

FreeSWITCH™的dialplan是一个决策树，提供路由服务：将呼叫桥接bridge在一起,执行dialplan应用程序,调用你写的自定义脚本等等。你的大部分努力将集中在配置一个dialplan以适合您的应用程序中,无论是内置XML dialplan或数据库查找查询发送到web服务器通过xmlcurl或通过使用freeswitch PostgreSQL连接池。

## Introduction

The FreeSWITCH™ Dialplan is not a single entity. You have the option to run different dialplan subsystems natively. These are not all translated into the same back–end as other systems may be employed. Instead each is a unique, independent method through which you can access information.
FreeSWITCH™的Dialplan不是一个单一的实体。你可以选择不同的本地dialplan子系统。这些不是都翻译成相同的后端与其他系统可能使用。不是每个都是独一无二的,独立的方法,通过它你可以访问信息。

Unlike some other switches, the dialplan is not designed to be an end all be all scripting language that you put a bunch of logic into. The dialplan, quite simply is designed to take a call request, decide where it should forward to and forward to an application. For example, you can route a call to the bridge application, and that application will spawn a new channel, and then connect the two channels; it can route to the conference application, or any other registered application in the FreeSWITCH™ system. Some of the most common applications you might want to use, such as mod_dptools: bridge, can be found in the documentation of the dptools module.

不像其他交换机,dialplan不是设计来把你的一群逻辑放在一起结束所有的脚本语言。dialplan,设计很简单，响应一个呼叫请求,决定它转向何处或转向一个应用程序。例如,您可以调用路由到桥的应用程序,应用程序将生成一个新的通道,然后连接两个渠道;它可以通往会议应用程序,或任何其他注册的应用程序在FreeSWITCH™系统。一些最常见的应用程序,您可能希望使用,如mod_dptools:桥,可以在文档中找到的dptools模块。

The design to allow for multiple dialplan processing modules as well as routing calls to applications which do all the hard work gives you the flexibility to do what you need the way that you need it to work. It does not force you to adapt your infrastructure around FreeSWITCH™ but lets FreeSWITCH™ more readily mesh with your existing infrastructure.

IMPORTANT

FreeSWITCH uses multiple 'contexts' to prevent internal extensions from being exposed to the world. The two contexts in the vanilla FS config are called "Public" and "Default" (but these names are arbitrary and can be carefully changed or other contexts added). Everything in the "public" context is available to the world, while everything in "default" context is only available to users that have registered with FreeSWITCH. You can define in the user profiles (the user directory) which context they belong to, and you can define the public context in the sofia configuration.

Anywhere you can specify a dialplan to route calls (such as mod_sofia's configuration), you may specify multiples by comma separating them.
