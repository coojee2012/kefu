## VAD Overview

VAD stands for Voice Activity Detection. Its role is to distinguish between a voice and anything else, including silence. In VoIP applications it may be used as a tool to minimize the number of audio packets transmitted. If nobody is speaking it is possible either to stop the flow of audio packets, or at least change to a much lower rate of comfort noise packets. In a typical phone conversation there are short periods when both parties are talking, but most of the time only one party is talking. With VAD, transmission in each direction can be greatly reduced, or even halted, for nearly 50% of the call. VAD is usually a function within the endpoints of a VoIP path.

VAD代表语音活动检测。它的作用是区分语音和其他,包括沉默。在VoIP应用程序可能使用它作为一种工具来减少音频数据包传输的数量。如果没有人说话,可以停止音频数据包的流动,或者至少改变舒适噪声包率更低。在一个典型的电话交谈双方谈话时短时间内,但大多数时候只是一方说话。和监督,在每个方向传输可以大大减少,甚至停止,近50%的电话。监督通常是一个函数的端点在VoIP的道路。

There are two things to note here, which often confuse people. VAD is not the same as silence detection. Loud music is certainly not silence, but it is also not voice, and a good VAD will declare "no voice present". Secondly, the use of VAD to minimize packet flow is often described as a bandwidth reduction measure. This is only the case for network links carrying large numbers of concurrent calls, when the likelihood of everyone talking at once is low. For most customer premises applications the bandwidth required of the network will be the peak when all conversations are declared to be voice, and packets are being transmitted at the normal rate of their voice codecs. What VAD allows in these cases is a reduction in the average data rate, freeing up lots of capacity for data which is not real-time data and therefore can be queued..

这里有两件事需要注意,这常常迷惑人。VAD检测是不一样的沉默。大声的音乐当然不是沉默,但也没有声音,好的VAD声明“没有声音”。其次,使用VAD减少数据包流经常被描述为一个带宽减少措施。这只是网络链接携带大量的并发调用,当每个人都说一次的可能性很低。对于大多数客户前提应用程序所需的带宽的网络将峰值声明当所有对话的声音,和数据包传输速度正常的语音编解码器。什么是通过允许在这些情况下减少平均数据速率,释放大量的数据不是实时数据的能力,因此可排队. .

## CNG Overview

CN stands for Comfort Noise. This is simulated background noise, synthesized at the receiving end of a VoIP path. This function is called comfort noise generation (CNG). In a crude form it may be simple simulation of general room "mush" (e.g. Gaussian noise with a Hoth spectral weighting). In a more sophisticated form, noise parameters received from the sender may contain noise modelling parameters. These may be used to produce noise which closely matches the amplitude and spectral qualities of the noise currently being picked up in the sender's environment.

CN代表舒适噪音。这是模拟的背景噪音,在接收端合成的VoIP的道路。这个函数被称为舒适噪音的产生(CNG)。原油的形式可能是一般的简单模拟房间“胆怯”(如高斯噪声霍斯谱加权)。在一个更复杂的形式,从发送者接收噪声参数可能包含噪声模型参数。这些可以用来产生噪声匹配噪音的振幅和光谱特性目前在发送方的环境。

CN also refers to the CN RTP packets specified by RFC 3389. CN packets are sent when the VAD function declares there is no voice present. A CN packet can convey the noise modelling parameters described above, but frequently this information is missing. Ideally CN packets should be sent as the noise in the sender's environment changes, so the CNG function at the receiver can update the noise effectively, and avoid abrupt changes in the noise when the voice signal resumes. More typically, just a single CN packet is sent as the flow of voice packets ceases.

CN也指的是CN RTP数据包由RFC 3389规定。CN数据包发送VAD函数声明时没有声音。CN包可以传达上述噪声模型参数,但是这些信息往往失踪。理想情况下CN数据包应该被作为发送方的环境中的噪声变化,所以CNG接收机可以有效更新噪声函数,并避免突然的变化噪声语音信号时的简历。一般来说,只是一个CN数据包发送语音数据包停止流动。

## VAD in FreeSWITCH

VAD can be set in endpoint profiles and can have 4 values:

in - turn on VAD for incoming media,
out - turn on VAD for outgoing media,
both - turn on VAD for both incoming and outgoing media,
none - VAD is completely turned off.
When FreeSWITCH does not detect speech, it stops transmitting RTP. FreeSWITCH also supports per call VAD handling with the following channel variables:

rtp_enable_vad_in
rtp_enable_vad_out
rtp_disable_vad_in
rtp_disable_vad_out
CNG in FreeSWITCH
In FreeSWITCH the CNG options select whether or not FreeSWITCH will generate CN RTP packets. The suppress-cng sofia profile option and suppress_cng channel variable control this setting. When both sides support RFC 3389 (they agree in SDP message exchange, rtpmap:13), FreeSWITCH will send CN packets.

Allowing CNG in FreeSWITCH does not mean it will generate any comfort noise into the media channel.

In case one of the call legs does not handle VAD and asynchronous RTP media, it's possible that the listening caller might think that hearing perfect silence means the connection has been dropped. For handling these endpoints, there is a channel variable: bridge_generate_comfort_noise which will generate fake audio.

Applicable Settings
Channel Variables
bridge_generate_comfort_noise — Generates comfort noise when bridged session is receiving discontinuous audio frames (silence suppression).
rtp_enable_vad_in
rtp_enable_vad_out
rtp_disable_vad_in
rtp_disable_vad_out
send_silence_when_idle — When set greater than 0, this variable tells FreeSWITCH to transmit comfort noise when idle.
suppress_cng — This can be used to stop a remote party, typically a handset, from using silence suppression. Poorly implemented silence suppression can result in lost speech, and this is a way to fix that, at the cost of greater bandwidth consumption.
Profile Parameters
suppress-cng — Suppress Comfort Noise Generator (CNG) on this profile or per call with the 'suppress_cng' variable.

## Silence File Type

To assign silence as a source of music on hold or ringback use this syntax:

 `silence[:<level>]`
The higher the level, the lower the volume. Default value is approximately 400. Set the value in the appropriate channel variable:

Playing silence as a file type

```xml
<action application="set" data="hold_music=silence"/>
<action application="set" data="ringback=silence"/>
<action application="set" data="transfer_ringback=silence"/>
```
