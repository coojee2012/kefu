# Codecs and Media

## About

A codec is an encoding and compression scheme for a media stream or file format. The term is an acronym derived from COding and DECoding. See this article for more technical information: [url](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec). FreeSWITCH™ has provisions for bypassing the media server altogether to save bandwidth and load on the server as well as proxy media in cases where a particular codec is not supported; this allows devices to exchange media directly between them.
编解码器是一个媒体流的编码和压缩方案或文件格式。这个词是一个缩写词来源于编码和解码。看到这篇文章更多的技术信息:[连接](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec)。FreeSWITCH™已经完全绕过规定媒体服务器节省带宽和服务器上的负载以及代理媒体在一个特定的编解码器不支持的情况下;这允许设备之间直接交换媒体。

## HD Audio support 高清音频支持

FreeSWITCH supports most HD (high definition) audio codecs including Speex, G.722, G.722.1 (Siren) and SILK. BroadVoice codecs were added by Brian (bkw) just 90 minutes after official release.

## Enabling codecs in modules.conf.xml

FreeSWITCH supports a large number of VoIP compression codecs out of the box, however the default config does not enable them all for all transport types. Codecs are built from various modules and from the core FreeSWITCH source (no need to load modules for core codecs, they are in CORE_PCM_MODULE, e.g. they're built into the core of FreeSWITCH). For codecs not in core, you need to compile and load the corresponding module.
FreeSWITCH支持大量的网络语音压缩编解码器的盒子,但是默认配置不使他们所有的运输类型。编解码器是建立从各个模块和核心FreeSWITCH源(不需要加载模块为核心的编解码器,在CORE_PCM_MODULE如他们内置FreeSWITCH的核心)。编解码器不是核心,您需要编译并加载相应的模块。
Some codecs are encumbered by patents, therefore they are not open source and can not be distributed directly. Licenses are available for purchase where applicable.
有些编解码器的专利,因此他们不是开源的,不能直接分发。许可证可用于购买适用的地方。
Executing the fs_cli command "show codec" displays the enabled codecs.

The vars.xml file contains the the following lines that globally control which codecs are negotiated with remote endpoints:

```xml
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="global_codec_prefs=G722,PCMA,PCMU,GSM"/>
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="outbound_codec_prefs=G722,PCMA,PCMU,GSM"/>
```

Note: iLBC@30i configures the iLBC codec to default to 30ms frames instead of 20ms frames which will allow you to receive iLBC calls from Asterisk servers which unfortunately do not correctly send their iLBC codec preferences.

Most transports (channels) have a config block at the top of their configuration file like the following:
大多数传输(渠道)配置块顶部的配置文件如下:

```xml
<settings>
  <param name="codec-prefs" value="XXXXXXX"/>
</settings>
```

Note: There are generally other lines inside the `<settings>` block, but you can safely ignore them for now.

dingaling.conf.xml file
The default dingaling.conf.xml config contains the following (codec related) settings:

```xml
<settings>
  <param name="codec-prefs" value="PCMU"/>
</settings>
```

While you may use almost any codec you wish when using dingaling to talk between two FreeSWITCH servers, the official Google Talk(tm) client has some very peculiar quirks in its codec handling.

sofia.conf.xml file
The default sofia.conf.xml config contains the following settings related to codecs:

```xml
<settings>
 <param name="inbound-codec-prefs" value="$${global_codec_prefs}"/>
 <param name="outbound-codec-prefs" value="$${global_codec_prefs}"/>
</settings>
```

This allows Sofia-SIP to inherit the global_codec_prefs which we configured in vars.xml. It's best to leave it that way, however you may manually specify a codec list if you wish.
这允许Sofia-SIP继承vars.xml中global_codec_prefs的配置。最好是离开它,但是如果你愿意,你可以手动指定一个编码清单。

## Media proxying

FreeSWITCH can proxy media between endpoints if is NATed or you want to reduce usage of your CPU
FreeSWITCH可以代理媒体端点之间如果是nat之后或你想减少你的CPU的使用情况

## Benefits of proxy media 代理媒体的好处

Lower CPU usage*
N.A.T. handling (RTP Side)
Pass–through not supported Codecs like G721, G728, G719, AMR and some other codecs*
Video conferencing through external MCU
Codecs ofered by Proxy_media
PROXY PASS-THROUGH to pass audio media in proxy mode
PROXY VIDEO PASS-THROUGH to pass video media in proxy mode
