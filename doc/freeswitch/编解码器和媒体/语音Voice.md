There are two parts to making this works in FreeSwitch:
mod_say_fr must be updated with the patch found in [](http://jira.freeswitch.org/browse/FSCORE-528)
You must download the sound files appropriate for your network (most people will want the 8000 Hz files) from [](http://www.archive.org/details/FrenchAudioFilesForFreeswitch)
The files were created by Sibylle Luperce & Philippe Leroy for Neuronnexion.coop, who put them under a Creative Commons license.
